# Detection-of-Genuine-and-Forged-Banknotes-using-K-Means-Clustering

This project aims to develop a classification model using K-Means clustering to distinguish between genuine and forged banknotes. The dataset consists of features extracted from images of banknotes, and the model is trained to accurately classify banknotes as either genuine or forged. Through extensive data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, the effectiveness of K-Means clustering in detecting counterfeit banknotes is assessed
